## About this repo

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio and resume site. The project uses Vite with React and outputs a production build into the `docs/` folder so GitHub Pages can serve the site from the `main` branch.

## Tech stack

- React
- Vite
- TypeScript (build step includes `tsc`)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Quick start

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build a production site (output written to `docs/`):

```
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```
npm run preview
```

To publish (this repo publishes `docs/` on the `main` branch):

```
# build, add, commit and push
npm run build
git add docs && git commit -m "chore: publish production build to docs" && git push origin main
```
